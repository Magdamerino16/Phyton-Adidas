# Phyton-Adidas
**This was a data analysis project done in python as part of CareerFoundry's data analysis course.**

## Objective
**Adidas is the world's second-largest sportswear manufacturer, with annual revenue of over â‚¬25 billion. However, in today's increasingly competitive market, the brand needs to find new ways to reach its target audience. The objective of this analysis is to explore and find some new marketing  ideas that Adidas could use to stay ahead of the competition.**

## Data
**The data and information used were obtained from Kaggle, a data science platform that aggregates data from a variety of sources, including Adidas itself, market research companies, government agencies, and other organizations that track sales data. This allows us to obtain specific data that would not be available from a single source.**

## Tools
**The following libraries were used for Python:**

- Panda
* Numpy
+ Seaborn
- Matplotlib
* Scipy
+ Sklearn
- Pylab
